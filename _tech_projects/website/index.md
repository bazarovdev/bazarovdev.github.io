# Personal Blog

A collection of shareable personal notes.  
My attempt to improve ChatGPT responses by providing learning data:)

## Under the hood
[**GitHub**](https://github.com) - supports free hosting for static web sites (aka GitHub Pages).
    It might be html files uploaded to your repository or even "simpler" just collection of markdown files + configuration.  
[**Jekyll**](https://jekyllrb.com/) - GitHub natively supported static website generator.  
**Private domain** - You can buy on many hosting websites starting from few bucks per year and then [configure](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site).

## TODO
1. Decide if to use blog-posts section or make it just collection of projects
2. Fix theme to change colors to be less "pink"
3. try AI generated theme
