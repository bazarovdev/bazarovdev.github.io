## Interests and experience
- **SW development:**
  - Python
  - Linux (Yocto, cross-compiling, modifying drivers, kernel modules, MAKE, shell)
  - Modern C++ 
  - Matlab (including wrapping .NET and C++ libraries and drivers)
  - Old experience with LabVIEW and .NET
- **3D:**
  - Simulation of optical systems (vectors manipulations and projections using homogeneous coordinates)
  - 3D printing (slicing, materials mixing, color representation, Klipper/Marlin FW)
- **New Product Introduction (NPI):**
  - Bring up PCBA for production test stations, writing tests, management of stations on production line (Python, PyQt, Linux, RPi, SaltProject.io)
- **Data Acquisition (DAQ), Systems Validation and Performance Analysis:**
  - LIDAR performance over full FoV over different Sun levels and temperatures (TEC, laser drivers, gimbals and rails, sun simulator)
  - Performance evaluation of a time-frequency multiplexed RF system under interference from adjacent frequency bands. (Circulators, controllable attenuators, protocol simulators)
- **HW**:
  - Designing Digital and Analog circuits, DAC/ADC, MCU-s, FPGA-s, filters, power supplies
  - Working with various interfaces: I2C, SPI, UART, USB, CAN, JTAG
